NetHammer Project Work Plan
Here's a comprehensive work plan for building NetHammer, a terminal UI tool for controlling and monitoring Pod network scaling and stress tests using Ratatui:

Phase 1: Setup and Architecture (Week 1)
Project Dependencies
Update Cargo.toml with required dependencies:
ratatui for the terminal UI
crossterm for terminal manipulation
tokio for async runtime
clap for command-line arguments
serde and serde_json for configuration
Core Architecture
Define the app state and UI component structure
Create a basic event handling system (keyboard/mouse inputs)
Implement the main application loop with proper terminal setup/teardown
Integration with Pod Network
Define network control interfaces to start/stop replica nodes and clients
Create utilities to parse logs and metrics from running instances
Establish a monitoring system for network events
Phase 2: UI Components Development (Week 2)
Layout Design
Design the overall UI layout with panels for:
Network topology visualization
Performance metrics and statistics
Log viewer
Control panel
Core UI Components
Implement network visualization panel showing nodes and connections
Build performance metrics panel with graphs for throughput, latency, etc.
Create log viewer for real-time monitoring
Develop control panel for test configuration
Interactive Controls
Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
Implement command input for advanced operations
Create popup dialogs for configuration options
Phase 3: Network Testing Features (Week 3)
Test Configuration
Create configuration system for defining test parameters:
Number of replicas and clients
Transaction types and rates
Fault injection parameters
Test duration and stopping conditions
Benchmark Implementations
Implement throughput testing (transactions per second)
Add latency measurement system
Create fault tolerance tests (node failures, network partitions)
Develop load escalation tests
Results Collection
Build a system to collect and aggregate results
Implement real-time metrics calculation and display
Create exportable reports in JSON/CSV format
Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinement (Week 4)
Advanced Testing Scenarios
Implement scenario scripting for complex test sequences
Add randomized fault injection capabilities
Create comparative testing between configurations
Visualization Enhancements
Add interactive network topology graph
Implement customizable dashboard layouts
Create animated visualizations for data flow
Documentation and Packaging
Write comprehensive README with usage examples
Create demo scripts for common test scenarios
Package for easy installation
Technical Implementation Details

Immediate Next Steps
Update the Cargo.toml with initial dependencies
Create the basic application structure with Ratatui
Implement terminal setup and event loop
Build the first UI prototype with placeholder data
This plan provides a structured approach to developing NetHammer while ensuring you can have incremental working versions throughout the development process.
